I. Processes to follow in the Project

Project Setup

Install Laravel, Composer and XAMPP (or any other local server that supports PHP and MySQL).
Create a new Laravel project using the command composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel projectname.
Frontend Development

Create your views using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Laravel uses the Blade templating engine, so you'll create .blade.php files in the resources/views directory.
You can use Laravel Mix to compile your CSS.
OCR Functionality

For OCR functionality, you can use the Tesseract OCR engine. It's open-source and has support for many languages, including French.
Install Tesseract on your server and use a PHP wrapper like thiagoalessio/tesseract_ocr for Laravel to interact with it.
Text Processing Algorithms

Depending on the structure of your documents, you might need to develop custom algorithms to extract the relevant information. This could involve string manipulation, regular expressions, or even machine learning for more complex tasks.
Database Setup

Laravel supports MySQL out of the box. You can define your database connections in the .env file.
Use Laravel's Eloquent ORM to interact with your database. You'll define your database structure using migrations and models.
Data Extraction and Storage

Once you've processed the text and extracted the relevant information, you can store it in your database using Eloquent.
Testing

Write unit tests to ensure your data extraction and storage processes work as expected. Laravel provides built-in support for testing with PHPUnit.
Deployment

Once everything is working as expected, you can deploy your application. Laravel supports several deployment options, including shared hosting, VPS, and platforms like Laravel Forge and Vapor.
Remember, this is a high-level guide and each step can involve a lot of work. You might also need to use additional tools or libraries depending on your specific requirements.

II - UI Features and Fountionalities

The UI of your application should be designed to facilitate the main functionalities of your project. Here are some features you might consider:

File Upload: A form to allow users to upload the documents (invoices, reports, etc.) they want to extract data from. This could be a simple file input or a drag-and-drop area.

File List: A list or table showing the files that have been uploaded, along with their status (e.g., pending, processing, completed). This could also include options to download or delete files.

Data View: Once the data has been extracted from a document, you'll need a way to display it. This could be a table showing the extracted data, or a more detailed view for each document.

Search and Filter: If you're dealing with a large number of documents, it might be useful to have a search bar and filters (by date, status, etc.) to help users find specific documents.

Error Handling: Display clear error messages if something goes wrong during the file upload or data extraction process.

Instructions: Clear instructions on how to use the application, what types of files are supported, etc.

Responsive Design: Ensure your UI is responsive and works well on different screen sizes, especially if users might be using the application on mobile devices.

Remember, the specific features will depend on your project requirements and user needs. It's always a good idea to involve your users in the design process, for example through user interviews or usability testing.
